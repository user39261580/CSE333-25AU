# CSE333-25AU: Systems Programming (Autumn 2025)

## Course Overview

CSE 333 (Systems Programming) is an intensive course that bridges the gap between high-level programming and system-level implementation. This course provides hands-on experience with C and C++ programming, focusing on memory management, system calls, network programming, and performance optimization.

## About This Repository

This repository contains coursework completed while **auditing CSE333 as an ECE (Electrical and Computer Engineering) student**. Despite auditing status, I followed all course requirements, completed all assignments, and maintained the same academic standards expected of enrolled students. The experience provided invaluable insights into systems programming that directly complement my ECE background.

### Why I Audited This Course

As an ECE student, I was particularly interested in:
- **Low-level programming skills** essential for embedded systems development
- **Memory management** techniques crucial for resource-constrained environments
- **Network programming** for IoT and distributed systems applications
- **Performance optimization** relevant to real-time systems
- **C/C++ expertise** fundamental for hardware-software integration
