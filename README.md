## Course Overview

Includes substantial programming experience in languages that expose machine characteristics and low-level data representation (e.g., C and C++); explicit memory management; modern libraries and language features; interacting with operating-system services; introduction to concurrent programming.

## About This Repository

This repository contains coursework completed while **auditing CSE333 as an ECE student**. Despite my auditing status, I followed all course requirements, completed all assignments, and maintained the same academic standards expected of enrolled students. The experience provided invaluable insights into systems programming that directly complement my ECE background.

### Why I Audited This Course

As an ECE student, this is a critical course preparing me for the OS course.

## Academic Approach

<!-- ### Audit Student Commitment
Even as an auditing student, I maintained full engagement by:
- **Attending all lectures and sections** and participating in discussions
- **Completing all assignments** with the same rigor as enrolled students
- **Following academic integrity policies** strictly
- **Seeking help during office hours** when needed
- **Collaborating appropriately** with other students on exercises -->

## Key Assignments Overview
